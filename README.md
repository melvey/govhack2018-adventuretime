# Everyday Active

## Why
We live in congested cities and can struggle to find the time to keep ourselves healthy. Why can't a little exercise be a normal part of our everyday lives?

Our app, Everyday Active, will encourage people to commute by bicycle and get out for a ride on the weekend. Commuting by car is both sedentary and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. Research has also shown that sedentary commutes contribute to stress, high BMI and even cases of influenza. A little exercise by cycling on your daily commute on the other hand has positive impacts for both your mental and physical, health and wellbeing.

## How
Everyday Active makes it easier for people to get out on their bicycle suggesting the easiest, shortest, or fastest routes to take. It will also let you know where you can park your bike or hire one from existing outlets. If you want to grab coffee on the way, it can show other places of interest for you to stop in at without going too far out of your way.

By making it easier to cycle, we will reduce car parking demands and assist everyday Australians to incorporate more regular exercise into their daily routines. We want to make it easy and fun to stay healthy and fit for both new and existing riders.
